# Speed Detector GUI

## Overview

The **Speed Detector GUI** is a simple Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that calculates the speed of a moving object based on user-inputted values for initial position, final position, and time taken. The application is built using Java Swing for the GUI components.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to input initial position, final position, and time.
- Calculates speed in **meters per second (m/s)** and **kilometers per hour (km/h)**.
- Displays the computed speed in real-time.
- Provides error handling for invalid inputs.

## How It Works

1. The user enters the **initial position** (in meters).
2. The user enters the **final position** (in meters).
3. The user enters the **time taken** (in seconds).
4. Upon clicking the **"Calculate Speed"** button, the speed is calculated using the formula:

Speed = (Final Position - Initial Position) / Time Taken


- The result is shown in both **m/s** and **km/h**.

5. If invalid inputs are entered, the application displays an error message.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans) or a terminal to run the program.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

Compile and run the program:

javac SpeedDetectorGUI.java
java SpeedDetectorGUI

The GUI window will open, allowing you to enter values and calculate speed.

Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
Swing (javax.swing): Used for creating the graphical user interface.
AWT (java.awt): Provides UI components and event handling.
Future Enhancements
Add unit selection (meters, miles).
Implement a history log to store previous calculations.
Improve UI design with better layout and styling.
